# Three is a CrowdÂ¶
# Make a list of names that includes at least four people.
# Write an if test that prints a message about the room being crowded, if there are more than three people in your list.
# Modify your list so that there are only two people in it. Use one of the methods for removing people from the list, don't just redefine the list.
# Run your if test again. There should be no output this time, because there are less than three people in the list.
# Bonus: Store your if test in a function called something like crowd_test.
names = ['Jim','James','Jimbo','Jimothy']
