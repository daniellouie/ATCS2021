# Exercises
# Pet Names
# Create a dictionary to hold information about pets. Each key is an animal's name, and each value is the kind of animal.
# For example, 'ziggy': 'canary'
# Put at least 3 key-value pairs in your dictionary.
# Use a for loop to print out a series of statements such as "Willie is a dog."
pet_info = {'Nautica': 'yellow lab','Woola': 'black lab','smokey': 'bear'}

for i in pet_info:
    print(i + " is a " + pet_info[i])
